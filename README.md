## Why?

Archipelago is inspired by [Hyper](https://github.com/zeit/hyper). I
started using Hyper as my default terminal while it was in beta and into
v1. It was by far the coolest, best looking, minimal, and extensible
terminal emulator I had used. But, I found it to be really slow, to the
point where if I was going to run a command that I knew would have a lot of
output, I would opt for using a different terminal. Along with that,
occasionally buffers would overlap making the terminal unreadable and
force me to restart.

At the time Hyper was using [Hterm](https://github.com/chromium/hterm)
which was the culprit of all my issues, so I found the
[Xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) project which solved all these problems
and I started making Archipelago. Archipelago works on macOS, Linux, and
Windows, supports theming which can be saved to a profile, searching
through the scroll-back, a visor pop over, pane splitting, system tests,
and much more. Visit [archipelago.dev](https://archipelago.dev) to see
